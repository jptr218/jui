# Getting started

In order to create your first ever JUI application, you will need to set the correct Visual Studio c++ paths. To do this, **right click on your project, select properties -> VC++ directories, and set the include path and the library path to the folder extracted from the ZIP**.

Once you have done that, you can start writing your code. Start off by opening a new jui_window object:
```
uhuo
```
