If you've followed the previous chapter, you should have a blank window. Since blank windows are boring, let's add some life to it. We can start by adding the following line before the `deploy()` function is called:
```
w.text("My text", 20, 20, 30, "Arial");                          //Draw text
```
In the next chapter, we will start drawing shapes to the window.
