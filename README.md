## JUI is a short UI library I wrote for beginners. It has enough functionality to make a basic windows app, but it's not very polished and shouldn't be used for large scale projects.

# You can download the library [here](https://github.com/jptr218/jui/raw/main/jui.zip). To install just set your visual studio include and library paths to the zip, after you've extracted it.

# For more info, check the [manual](https://github.com/jptr218/jui/blob/main/man/getting_started.md) I wrote.
